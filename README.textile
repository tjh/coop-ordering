== Coop Ordering

This is an application designed for the Fry Farms Coop to handle their online order placement for coop members and herd owners.

Members/owners place orders before a deadline, with order batches closing at a pre-set time. Any order that's not received by the cut-off will go into the next batch.

This system replaced a manual process with each member/owner sending an email explaining what they wanted to one person who had to decipher and collate over 100 orders.
